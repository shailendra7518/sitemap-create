          Every project is unique – and hence requires a dedicated and special
          treatment. Besides the critical triangle of cost, time and scope, the
          working model between the ‘client’ and the ‘agency’ also plays a
          crucial role in balancing the former.
        </p>
        <p className="content-details">
          That’s why we have clear and robust project execution models which are
          very flexible and client-centric at their core. But before embarking
          on any project, whether it’s a simple website or a more complex
          software development, it is important we help you employ the ‘correct’
          project execution model.

          “A project might be completed without the use of a project execution
          process, but most times, the absence of one leads to the failure of
          it”.

        <p className="content-details">
          Out of the numerous project management methodologies available, we
          make use of the two rather popular methodologies. The Waterfall
          Methodology, and The Agile Methodology. Each of these methodologies
          has the specific type of projects they are best used with. Identifying
          just the right strategy and execution model based on project
          characteristics is a crucial decision that our team of experts helps
          you make.
