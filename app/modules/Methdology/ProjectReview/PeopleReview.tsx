                For any project to sustain in a predictive way to ensure the
                core 3 triangles of scope, time and budget remains predicted,
                there must be a structure to see beyond numbers. Unlike many
                others – we don’t just look at numbers.

                The core purpose is not only to share project requirements, but
                also to understand client expectations and facilitate them with
                our quality and experience.

                To do so, we involve key stakeholders who drive the project as
                well as some of the neutral but well experienced members from
                other teams to take a look at the results and elevate the
                project situation to a greater satisfaction level.
