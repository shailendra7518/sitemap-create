    "All of the projects on in the development stage are reviewed every 2 weeks at least. In certain cases, for the projects that are slow, we review them at least once in a month. The aim is to review project timeline, open issues, current team feedback, efforts burn down, delivery milestones and overall schedule of the project.",
